### Currently searching for a PhD student position

Please note that this is a *real* resume, and I'm really looking for a PhD
student position at the moment. I made this resume because Yihui asked me
if I'd like to test the **pagedown** package with my resume. If you are
interested in my background and skills, please feel free to contact me.
