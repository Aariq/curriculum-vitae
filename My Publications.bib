abstract = {Plants often experience multiple sources of stress simultaneously, yet little is known about interactive effects of multiple stressors on plant metabolic responses. Plants are well known to respond to both drought and insect herbivory through the induced production of secondary metabolites. However, severe drought stress limits photosynthesis and may therefore inhibit the production of induced secondary metabolites in response to herbivory due to carbon limitation. On the other hand, drought-stressed plants may be primed to respond more strongly to herbivory due to hormonal crosstalk or redundancy of metabolites that are produced in response to drought and herbivory. We tested the interactive effects of drought and simulated herbivory in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze var. sinensis) grown in the field under varying rainfall interception treatments and then exposed to an exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. We show that severe drought generally inhibits the induction of secondary metabolites by exogenous MeJA (simulated herbivory). However, a few volatile metabolites, including methyl salicylate, are more strongly induced by MeJA in severely drought-stressed plants compared to moderately stressed plants, possibly due to priming by drought stress. Our approach of using multiple levels of drought stress and a targeted/untargeted approach to measuring volatile metabolites was essential to discovering these patterns of induction. In addition to having implications for plant-herbivore interactions in the presence of abiotic stress, these results have important implications for tea quality.},

abstract = {Climate effects on crop quality at the molecular level are not well-understood. Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to measure changes of hundreds of compounds in tea at different elevations in Yunnan Province, China. Some increased in concentration while others decreased by 100's of percent. Orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis revealed compounds exhibiting analgesic, antianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer, antidepressant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-stress, and cardioprotective properties statistically (p=0.003) differentiated high from low elevation tea. Also, sweet, floral, honey-like notes were higher in concentration in the former while the latter displayed grassy, hay-like aroma. In addition, multivariate analysis of variance showed low elevation tea had statistically (p=0.0062) higher concentrations of caffeine, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and catechin; all bitter compounds. Although volatiles represent a small fraction of the total mass, this is the first comprehensive report illustrating how normal variations in temperature, 5 Â°C, due to elevational effects impact tea quality.},

abstract = {Plants produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with diverse structures and functions, which change in response to environmental stimuli and have important consequences for interactions with other organisms. To understand these changes, in situ sampling is necessary. In contrast to dynamic headspace (DHS), which is the most often employed method, direct contact sampling employing a magnetic stir bar held in place by a magnet eliminates artifacts produced by enclosing plant materials in glass or plastic chambers. Direct-contact sorptive extraction (DCSE) using polydimethylsiloxane coated stir bars (Twisters) coated stir bars is more sensitive than DHS, captures a wider range of compounds, minimizes VOC collection from neighboring plants, and distinguishes the effects of herbivory in controlled and field conditions. Because DCSE is relatively inexpensive and simple to employ, scalability of field trials can be expanded concomitant with increased sample replication. The sensitivity of DCSE combined with the spectral deconvolution data analysis software makes the two ideal for comprehensive, in situ profiling of plant volatiles.},

abstract = {The four species of Dasineura Rondani previously reported from golden rods in North America were revisited, resulting in the synonymy of two species and the redescription of diagnostic characters of adults and galls. Dasineura folliculi Felt is reported from Solidago rugosa Miller and S. gigantea Aiton, and D. carbonaria Felt is reported from Euthamia graminifolia (L.) Nuttall. Both species induce simple leaf-cluster galls on shoot tips of their relative hosts. Dasineura folliculi completes for to five generations, and D. carbonaria completes at least two generations between May and October. Emergence rates were relatively low; they ranged from 36 to 51{\%}, suggesting a large proportion of the larval population does not pupate and instead enters diapause in the ground. D. folliculi galls were attacked by five species of parasitic wasps and by inquilinous and predatory gall midges and caterpillars. Levels of attack by parasitoids increased, whereas levels of attack by inquilines decreased, as the season progressed. Field data and greenhouse experiments indicated that both Dasineura species exhibit monogeny, whereby females produce unisexual broods. Galls resulting from a single oviposition event exclusively yielded single-sex adults, whereas 7-33{\%} of field-collected galls yielded adults of both sexes, suggesting they contained the progeny of more than one female. Gall sex ratios differed between generations of D. folliculi on S. rugosa but not on S. gigantea.},

This is the first record of Macrolabis outside the Palaearctic, where the genus is represented by 58 species. Contrary to what is known of most Macrolabis species, the new species is multivoltine and is found in galls induced by successive generations of D. folliculi. Despite certain biological similarities to Macrolabis solidaginis Fedotova, which is associated with Dasineura galls on goldenrod in Kazakhstan, its relations to its Eurasian congeners are currently unknown. Adults, larvae, galls, and life history of the new species are described.},

abstract = {Host-associated differentiation (HAD) is considered a step towards ecological speciation and an important mechanism promoting diversification in phytophagous insects. Although the number of documented cases of HAD is increasing, these still represent only a small fraction of species and feeding guilds among phytophagous insects, and most reports are based on a single type of evidence. Here we employ a comprehensive approach to present behavioural, morphological, ecological and genetic evidence for the occurrence of HAD in the gall midge Dasineura folliculi (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on two sympatric species of goldenrods (Solidago rugosa and S. gigantea). Controlled experiments revealed assortative mating and strong oviposition fidelity for the natal-host species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed an amount of genetic divergence between the two host-associated populations compatible with cryptic species rather than host races. Lower levels of within-host genetic divergence, gall development and natural-enemy attack in the S. gigantea population suggest this is the derived host.},
