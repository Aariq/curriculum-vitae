# Eric Scott's Curriculum Vitae

My CV made using the [vitae](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/vitae) package for R and a data science résumé built using the [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) package.

**NOTE**: If I were to do this all over again, and had tons of time, I'd probably build my CV with `pagedown` and learn CSS to customize it.  `vitae` is great, but difficult to customize without knowing LaTeX.
