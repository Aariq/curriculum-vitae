# Eric Scott's Curriculum Vitae

My CV made using the [vitae](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/vitae) package for R and a data science résumé built using the [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) package.

I'm actively looking for postdoc positions, so if you like what you see, please do contact me!
