  abstract = {Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology are increasingly dependent on computational code to conduct research. Hence, the use of efficient methods to share, reproduce, and collaborate on code as well as document research is fundamental. GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and other materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses, and protocols. Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.},

  abstract = {One key evolutionary innovation that separates vertebrates from invertebrates is the notochord, a central element that provides the stiffness needed for powerful movements. Later, the notochord was further stiffened by the vertebrae, cartilaginous and bony elements, surrounding the notochord. The ancestral notochord is retained in modern vertebrates as intervertebral material, but we know little about its mechanical interactions with surrounding vertebrae. In this study, the internal shape of the vertebrae\textemdash where this material is found\textemdash was quantified in sixteen species of fishes with various body shapes, swimming modes, and habitats. We used micro-computed tomography to measure the internal shape. We then created and mechanically tested physical models of intervertebral joints. We also mechanically tested actual vertebrae of five species. Material testing shows that internal morphology of the centrum significantly affects bending and torsional stiffness. Finally, we performed swimming trials to gather kinematic data. Combining these data, we created a model that uses internal vertebral morphology to make predictions about swimming kinematics and mechanics. We used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to assess the relationship between vertebral shape and our categorical traits. The analysis revealed that internal vertebral morphology is sufficient to predict habitat, body shape, and swimming mode in our fishes. This model can also be used to make predictions about swimming in fishes not easily studied in the lab, such as deep sea and extinct species, allowing the development of hypotheses about their natural behavior.},

Here we employ a comprehensive approach to present behavioural, morphological, ecological and genetic evidence for the occurrence of HAD in the gall midge Dasineura folliculi (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on two sympatric species of goldenrods (Solidago rugosa and S. gigantea). Controlled experiments revealed assortative mating and strong oviposition fidelity for the natal-host species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed an amount of genetic divergence between the two host-associated populations compatible with cryptic species rather than host races. Lower levels of within-host genetic divergence, gall development and natural-enemy attack in the S. gigantea population suggest this is the derived host.},

Dasineura folliculi Felt is reported from Solidago rugosa Miller and S. gigantea Aiton, and D. carbonaria Felt is reported from Euthamia graminifolia (L.) Nuttall. Both species induce simple leaf-cluster galls on shoot tips of their relative hosts. Dasineura folliculi completes for to five generations, and D. carbonaria completes at least two generations between May and October. Emergence rates were relatively low; they ranged from 36 to 51\%, suggesting a large proportion of the larval population does not pupate and instead enters diapause in the ground. D. folliculi galls were attacked by five species of parasitic wasps and by inquilinous and predatory gall midges and caterpillars. Levels of attack by parasitoids increased, whereas levels of attack by inquilines decreased, as the season progressed. Field data and greenhouse experiments indicated that both Dasineura species exhibit monogeny, whereby females produce unisexual broods. Galls resulting from a single oviposition event exclusively yielded single-sex adults, whereas 7-33\% of field-collected galls yielded adults of both sexes, suggesting they contained the progeny of more than one female. Gall sex ratios differed between generations of D. folliculi on S. rugosa but not on S. gigantea.},

  abstract = {Changing patterns of precipitation are causing moisture stress in ways that alters crop growth and nutrition. Moisture stress not only directly impacts plant physiology but also indirectly affects plant growth by altering soil conditions. While the direct effects of moisture stress on growth and physiology are well studied, outcomes are often examined only as a consequence of current water stress within a single growing season, without consideration of accumulated moisture-induced changes in soil properties that accrue over many seasons (legacy effects). Moreover, our understanding of the impacts of current and legacy effects on both crop growth and nutrition are lacking. To explore these connections, the infrastructure of the Boston Area Climate Experiment (BACE) was leveraged to examine the responses of kale (Brassica oleracea), oat (Avena sativa) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) to three levels of precipitation (ambient, 75 \% of ambient, and 50 \% of ambient) when grown in legacy soils obtained from 10 years of differential precipitation inputs (high, medium, or low water). Plant growth was measured weekly, and nutritional differences within the edible portions of each crop were assessed at the end of the season. We found that differences in current precipitation affects both growth and nutrients, while legacy effects more strongly affect bionutrient levels than plant growth.},

To understand these changes, in situ sampling is necessary. In contrast to dynamic headspace (DHS), which is the most often employed method, direct contact sampling employing a magnetic stir bar held in place by a magnet eliminates artifacts produced by enclosing plant materials in glass or plastic chambers. Direct-contact sorptive extraction (DCSE) using polydimethylsiloxane coated stir bars (Twisters) coated stir bars is more sensitive than DHS, captures a wider range of compounds, minimizes VOC collection from neighboring plants, and distinguishes the effects of herbivory in controlled and field conditions. Because DCSE is relatively inexpensive and simple to employ, scalability of field trials can be expanded concomitant with increased sample replication. The sensitivity of DCSE combined with the spectral deconvolution data analysis software makes the two ideal for comprehensive, in situ profiling of plant volatiles.},

Principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis show seasonal, elevational, and yearly differences in tea from Yunnan and Fujian provinces. Independent of location, higher concentrations of compounds with aromas characteristic of farmers' perceptions of high-quality tea were found in spring and high elevation teas. Yunnan teas were distinct from Fujian teas, but the effects of elevation and season were different for the two locations. Elevation was the largest source of metabolite variation in Yunnan yet had no effect in Fujian. In contrast seasonal differences were strong in both locations. Importantly, the year-to-year variation in chemistry at both locations emphasizes the importance of doing multi-year studies, and further highlights the challenge farmers face when trying to produce teas with specific flavor/health (metabolite) profiles.},

  abstract = {Insect herbivores have dramatic effects on the chemical composition of plants. Many of these induced metabolites contribute to the quality (e.g. flavor, human health benefits) of specialty crops such as the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Induced chemical changes are often studied by comparing plants damaged and undamaged by herbivores. However, when herbivory is quantitative, the relationship between herbivore pressure and induction can be linearly or non-linearly density dependent or density independent, and induction may only occur after some threshold of herbivory. The shape of this relationship can vary among metabolites within plants. The tea green leafhopper (Empoasca onukii) can be a widespread pest on tea, but some tea farmers take advantage of leafhopper-induced metabolites in order to produce high-quality ``bug-bitten'' teas such as Eastern Beauty Oolong. To understand the effects of increasing leafhopper density on tea metabolites important for quality, we conducted a manipulative experiment exposing tea plants to feeding by a range of E. onukii densities. After E. onukii feeding, we measured volatile and non-volatile metabolites, and quantified percent damaged leaf area from scanned leaf images. E. onukii density had a highly significant effect on volatile production, while the effect of leaf damage was only marginally significant. The volatiles most responsive to leafhopper density were mainly terpenes that increased in concentration monotonically with density, while the volatiles most responsive to leaf damage were primarily fatty acid derivatives and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids. In contrast, damage (percent leaf area damaged), but not leafhopper density, significantly reduced total polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and theobromine concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of induced responses varied among metabolites with some changing linearly with herbivore pressure and some responding only after a threshold in herbivore pressure with a threshold around 0.6 insects/leaf being common. This study illustrates the importance of measuring a diversity of metabolites over a range of herbivory to fully understand the effects of herbivores on induced metabolites. Our study also shows that any increases in leafhopper density associated with climate warming, could have dramatic effects on secondary metabolites and tea quality.},

  abstract = {Deforestation often results in landscapes where remaining forest habitat is highly fragmented, with remnants of different sizes embedded in an often highly contrasting matrix. Local extinction of species from individual fragments is common, but the demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are poorly understood. It is often hypothesized that altered environmental conditions in fragments drive declines in reproduction, recruitment, or survivorship. The Amazon basin, in addition to experiencing continuing fragmentation, is experiencing climate change-related increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and unusually wet periods. Whether plant populations in tropical forest fragments are particularly susceptible to extremes in precipitation remains unclear. Most studies of plants in fragments are relatively short (1\textendash 6 years), focus on a single life-history stage, and often do not compare to populations in continuous forest. Even fewer studies consider delayed effects of climate on demographic vital rates despite the importance of delayed effects in studies that consider them. Using a decade of demographic and climate data from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the Central Amazon, we assess the effects of climate on populations of an understory herb (Heliconia acuminata, Heliconiaceae). We used distributed lag nonlinear models to understand the delayed effects of climate (measured as standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI) on survival, growth, and flowering. We detected delayed effects of climate up to 36 months. Extremes in SPEI in the previous year reduced survival, drought in the wet season 8\textendash 11 months prior to the February census increased growth, and drought two dry seasons prior increased flowering probability. Effects of extremes in precipitation on survival and growth were more pronounced in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. The complex delayed effects of climate and habitat fragmentation in our study point to the importance of long-term demography experiments in understanding the effects of anthropogenic change on plant populations.},

  abstract = {Tea quality depends on plant metabolites that impact flavor, aroma, and health-beneficial properties. Plants respond to insect herbivory by altering the con- centration and blend of these metabolites, and many secondary metabolites are pro- duced only after insect attack. Research in tea and other plants shows that insect herbivores affect the concentrations of metabolites important to tea quality such as volatiles, polyphenols, methylxanthines, and amino acids. Plants, including tea, respond differently to different insect herbivores by producing different blends of metabolites. Tea plant metabolites also vary in their responses to increasing herbi- vore density which results in a change in metabolite blends as herbivore density changes. Because climate change is predicted to impact the density and species composition of insect herbivores in tea-growing regions of the world, induction of metabolic changes by insect herbivores represents a potentially important indirect effect of climate change on tea quality. Although it is often assumed that insect attack is detrimental to tea quality, there are some cases where tea quality is improved by herbivore-induced changes in tea metabolites. It is therefore possible that allowing some insect herbivory could be an important strategy for mitigating detrimental effects of climate on tea quality. Keywords},

  abstract = {Multivariate climate change is expected to impact insect densities and plant growth in complex, and potentially different, ways. Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a unique crop system where the increase in quality from chemical defences induced by Empoasca onukii (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) feeding can outweigh reductions in yield and make attack by this leafhopper desirable to tea farmers. Differential impacts of weather attributes on tea and herbivores could impact feasibility of this unique farming strategy in a rapidly changing climate. We monitored leafhopper densities and tea shoot growth at a tea farm in Fujian Province, China for 2 months (June and July). We used distributed lag non-linear models to capture potentially delayed and non-linear effects of weather attributes on tea growth and leafhopper densities. Weather attributes had contrasting effects on leafhopper density and tea shoot growth. Leafhopper densities were highest with low daily mean and maximum temperatures, while warm temperatures favoured tea growth. Effects of temperature on leafhoppers were delayed, while effects on tea growth were immediate. Precipitation reduced tea growth, and had a delayed positive effect on leafhopper density. The delayed effects of weather attributes on leafhoppers indicate that earlier, less conspicuous life stages (i.e. eggs and early instar nymphs) may be susceptible to desiccation. Although increasing annual mean temperature is commonly predicted to benefit multivoltine insect pests, our results show that cool, wet conditions benefit E. onukii during summer months when they are most abundant. These results have implications for tea green leafhopper management strategies.},

  abstract = {Plants often experience multiple sources of stress simultaneously, yet little is known about interactive effects of multiple stressors on plant metabolic responses. Plants are well known to respond to both drought and insect herbivory through the induced production of secondary metabolites. However, severe drought stress limits photosynthesis and may therefore inhibit the production of induced secondary metabolites in response to herbivory due to carbon limitation. On the other hand, drought-stressed plants may be primed to respond more strongly to herbivory due to hormonal crosstalk or redundancy of metabolites that are produced in response to drought and herbivory. We tested the interactive effects of drought and simulated herbivory in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze var. sinensis) grown in the field under varying rainfall interception treatments and then exposed to an exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. We show that severe drought generally inhibits the induction of secondary metabolites by exogenous MeJA (simulated herbivory). However, a few volatile metabolites, including methyl salicylate, are more strongly induced by MeJA in severely drought-stressed plants compared to moderately stressed plants, possibly due to priming by drought stress. Our approach of using multiple levels of drought stress and a targeted/untargeted approach to measuring volatile metabolites was essential to discovering these patterns of induction. In addition to having implications for plant-herbivore interactions in the presence of abiotic stress, these results have important implications for tea quality.},

  abstract = {Ecologists often collect data with the aim of determining which of many variables are associated with a particular cause or consequence. Unsupervised analyses (e.g. principal components analysis, PCA) summarize variation in the data, without regard to the response. Supervised analyses (e.g., partial least squares, PLS) evaluate the variables to find the combination that best explain a causal relationship. These approaches are not interchangeable, especially when the variables most responsible for a causal relationship are not the greatest source of overall variation in the data\textemdash a situation that ecologists are likely to encounter. To illustrate the differences between unsupervised and supervised techniques, we analyze a published dataset using both PCA and PLS and compare the questions and answers associated with each method. We also use simulated datasets representing situations that further illustrate differences between unsupervised and supervised analyses. For simulated data with many correlated variables that were unrelated to the response, PLS was better than PCA at identifying which variables were associated with the response. There are many applications for both unsupervised and supervised approaches in ecology. However, PCA is currently overused, at least in part because supervised approaches, such as PLS, are less familiar.},
